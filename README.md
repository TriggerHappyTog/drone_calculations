# Drone Calculations

A small program I created to calculate pressure and density altitudes in aviation. Currently it is just a console application but I am hoping to create a GUI for it in the future.
The desire to create this program came about as a result of me learning about pressure and density altitudes during a drone pilot course I took earlier this year.
We had to work out the calculations by hand. I thought I could streamline the process by creating a program to do it for me. All I would have to do would be to input the different variables and have the program do the rest. This was the result. From my tests, it seems that the program can perform the calculations but I have not yet figured out how to create a GUI to house it in.
